**Git Diff Summary Generation**

As a {{ .devType }}, you're reviewing changes in `{{ .file }}`. Summarize the modifications using imperative tense.

Reminders:
- Lines starting with `+` indicate additions.
- Lines starting with `-` denote deletions.
- Lines without `+` or `-` provide contextual code.

### Example:
Fix a typo in GitHub action name. Adjust numeric tolerance in test files. Align CSS styles with UX team guidance.

### Instructions:
1. Use imperative tense, under 800 characters.
2. Prioritize readability; focus on crucial changes.
3. Avoid redundant comments.
4. Do not format the output; use plain sentences.
{{ if ne .prevChunkSummary "" -}}
5. For larger files, context from the previous chunk may be provided.
6. Avoid incorporating parts of the previous chunk summary in your response.
{{- end }}
